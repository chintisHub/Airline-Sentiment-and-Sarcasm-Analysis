# Sentiment Analysis with Tone Detection

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets mentioning major U.S. airlines, classifying them into **Positive**, **Neutral**, and **Negative** categories. It also categorizes negative tweets by specific reasons like "late flight" or "rude service." The model, trained using a **Naïve Bayes classifier**, is evaluated using metrics such as **F1-score**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **Accuracy**. To address class imbalance, **SMOTE** is applied.

The system incorporates **Tone detection (Sarcasm)** to identify nuanced tones and provides real-time predictions for user-inputted tweets. Tweets are preprocessed using techniques like stopword removal, URL stripping, and emoji handling before being analyzed.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to identify the sentiment of tweets generated by users on Twitter. The program trains a model that can classify tweets into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** sentiments with high accuracy. This analysis helps airlines understand customer feedback in real-time and improve their services accordingly.

---

## Motivation

Understanding the sentiment behind trending hashtags on Twitter can be challenging. While some hashtags may trend for positive reasons, others may trend due to negative feedback. This project aims to provide a data-driven method to analyze customer feedback in real-time, helping airlines respond to negative comments promptly. Additionally, the insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer experience, and protect brand value.

## Dataset

### Source of Data:
- **Kaggle Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is titled ["Twitter US Airline Sentiment"](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment) and was downloaded directly from Kaggle.
  
### Dataset Details:
- **Number of Tweets**: 14,640
- **Sentiment Categories**: Positive, Neutral, Negative
- **Additional Features**:
  - `text`: The content of the tweet.
  - `airline_sentiment`: Sentiment classification of the tweet.
  - `negative_reason`: Reasons for negative sentiment (if applicable).
  - Metadata such as `tweet_created`, `airline`, and `user_timezone`.

### Challenges:
- **Class Imbalance**: The dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance, with **negative tweets** dominating. To address this, we applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to balance the classes.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning

To ensure high-quality input for the model, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Stopword Removal**: Common words like "the", "is", "in" were removed.
- **URL Removal**: URLs were stripped from the text.
- **Punctuation Removal**: Punctuation marks like periods, commas, and exclamation marks were removed.
- **HTML Tag Removal**: HTML tags were removed from retweets or quoted content.
- **Username Removal**: Mentions of usernames (e.g., @username) were removed.
- **Emoji Removal**: Emojis were removed to simplify text processing.
- **Text Abbreviation Expansion**: Abbreviations like "can't" were expanded to "cannot".
- **Number Removal**: Numbers were removed as they generally don't contribute to sentiment.
- **Handling Repeated Characters**: Words with repeated characters (e.g., "hiiiiii") were normalized.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights from EDA include:

- **Sentiment Distribution**:
  - **Negative**: 9,178 tweets
  - **Neutral**: 3,099 tweets
  - **Positive**: 2,363 tweets
  - The dataset is heavily skewed towards negative tweets, necessitating the use of SMOTE for balancing.

- **Tweet Length Analysis**:
  - Average tweet length: 67 characters.
  - Tweet lengths are unimodal and roughly symmetric, with no significant outliers.

- **Hashtag Analysis**:
  - Common hashtags like `#fail`, `#help`, and airline-specific names were identified, indicating user concerns about delays and service quality.

- **Word Frequency Analysis**:
  - Frequent words like "delayed," "thank," and "service" were identified, reflecting common complaints or expressions of gratitude.

### Feature Engineering

- **Feature Scaling**: Tweet length and polarity were standardized using a scaler.
- **Mutual Information**: Applied to identify the most informative features for sentiment classification.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Used to convert text data into numerical feature vectors.

## Model Performance

Three models were evaluated using **stratified K-Fold cross-validation** with **SMOTE** to address class imbalance:

| Model            | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| MultinomialNB    | 84.60%   | 80.01%    | 76.28% | 77.63%   |
| GaussianNB       | 50.71%   | 47.36%    | 50.61% | 45.52%   |
| KNN              | 29.60%   | 54.10%    | 48.27% | 30.78%   |

- **Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MultinomialNB)** achieved the highest performance across all metrics, making it the chosen model for deployment.

## Real-Time Prediction Workflow

1. **Input Preprocessing**:
   - User input is cleaned using the same techniques applied during training (stopword removal, URL removal, etc.).
   
2. **Feature Vectorization**:
   - The preprocessed text is transformed into numerical feature vectors using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
   
3. **Sentiment Prediction**:
   - The **MultinomialNB** model predicts the sentiment of the input text as one of three classes: **Negative (0)**, **Neutral (1)**, or **Positive (2)**.
   
4. **Tone Detection**:
   - A separate sarcasm detection model is applied to identify potentially sarcastic inputs.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-airline-tweets.git
   ```
   Make sure to load Sarcasm and Twitter datasets with ipynb file for seamless execution of code.
## Interact with the Model

- Enter a tweet or text for sentiment analysis.
- The system will preprocess the input and return the sentiment prediction along with the probability distribution.

### Example:

**Input**:  
`"The flight was delayed, but the crew was very polite."`

**Output**:  
- **Sentiment Verdict**: Positive  
- **Tone Prediction**: Not Sarcastic  

## Exit

- Type `"quit"` to exit the application.

## Limitations

- **Class Imbalance**: Despite applying SMOTE, the dataset remains imbalanced, which could affect model performance.
- **Sarcasm Detection**: Sarcasm is difficult to detect accurately, and the current model may not always capture nuanced tones.
- **Temporal Trends**: The dataset is from 2015, and trends in customer sentiment may have evolved since then.
